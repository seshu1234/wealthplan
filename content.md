#### What Is Compound Interest?

Compound interest is the process by which interest is added to your principal balance, and then that combined amount earns interest in the next period. Unlike simple interest — which only pays interest on your original deposit — compound interest accelerates growth over time because you are constantly earning returns on a larger and larger base.

Albert Einstein is often (though likely apocryphally) credited with calling compound interest the eighth wonder of the world. Whether or not he said it, the math backs it up: a $10,000 investment earning 8% annually becomes $21,589 after 10 years, $46,610 after 20 years, and $100,627 after 30 years — all without adding a single additional dollar.

#### How Compound Frequency Affects Your Balance

Compounding can happen at different intervals: annually, quarterly, monthly, or even daily. The more frequently interest compounds, the faster your money grows — though the difference between monthly and daily compounding is smaller than most people expect.

Here is how a $10,000 investment at 8% annual rate grows over 10 years depending on compounding frequency:

- **Annually:** $21,589
- **Quarterly:** $21,911
- **Monthly:** $22,196
- **Daily:** $22,253

For most savings accounts and investments, monthly compounding is standard. What matters far more than compounding frequency is your contribution rate and how long you stay invested.

#### The Rule of 72

A quick mental math shortcut: divide 72 by your expected annual return rate to estimate how many years it takes your money to double.

- At 6% return: 72 ÷ 6 = **12 years to double**
- At 8% return: 72 ÷ 8 = **9 years to double**
- At 10% return: 72 ÷ 10 = **7.2 years to double**

This rule works because of the mathematics of exponential growth and is accurate within about 1–2% of the precise answer for rates between 4% and 15%.

#### How to Use This Calculator

1. Enter your **starting principal** — the amount you are investing today
2. Set your **annual interest rate** — use 7–10% for long-term stock market estimates, 4–5% for high-yield savings
3. Choose your **time period** in years
4. Select your **compounding frequency** — monthly is standard for most accounts
5. Optionally add **monthly contributions** to see how regular investing accelerates growth
6. Click Calculate to see your projected balance, total contributions, and total interest earned

#### What Return Rate Should I Use?

- **High-yield savings account:** 4.5–5.5% (current rates as of 2025)
- **US Treasury bonds:** 4–5%
- **Balanced portfolio (60% stocks / 40% bonds):** 6–7%
- **S&P 500 historical average:** ~10% nominal, ~7% inflation-adjusted
- **Individual stocks:** Highly variable — do not assume past performance

For retirement planning, most financial planners recommend using 6–7% as a conservative estimate for a diversified portfolio.

### FAQ Section

**Q: What is the difference between compound interest and simple interest?**
Simple interest is calculated only on your original principal. Compound interest is calculated on your principal plus all previously earned interest. Over long periods, the difference is enormous — compound interest creates exponential growth while simple interest creates linear growth.

**Q: How often does compound interest typically compound?**
Most savings accounts and money market accounts compound daily or monthly. CDs often compound daily. Investment accounts technically compound continuously since prices change every second. For practical calculations, monthly compounding is the standard assumption.

**Q: Can compound interest work against me?**
Yes — on debt. Credit card interest compounds monthly at rates of 20–29%, which means carrying a balance causes your debt to grow exponentially in the same way investments do. This is why paying off high-interest debt is mathematically equivalent to earning that same interest rate as a guaranteed investment return.

**Q: What is the best account to take advantage of compound interest?**
For long-term growth: a Roth IRA or 401(k) invested in low-cost index funds. For short-term savings: a high-yield savings account or money market account. The key advantage of tax-advantaged retirement accounts is that compound growth is not taxed annually, which allows the full compounding effect to work uninterrupted.

**Q: How accurate is this compound interest calculator?**
This calculator uses the standard compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) + PMT × [((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n)], where P is principal, r is annual rate, n is compounding frequency, t is time in years, and PMT is periodic contribution. Results are mathematically precise given the inputs — actual investment returns will vary.

## 2. Mortgage Calculator

**URL:** `/calculators/mortgage-calculator`
**Title tag:** `Mortgage Calculator (2025) — Monthly Payment & Amortization — Wealthplan`
**Meta description:** `Calculate your monthly mortgage payment including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. See a full amortization schedule and compare 15-year vs 30-year loans.`

### Intro

Calculate your exact monthly mortgage payment including principal, interest, property taxes, HOA fees, and PMI. View your full amortization schedule and see exactly how much interest you will pay over the life of your loan.

---

### SEO Content (below calculator)

#### How Mortgage Payments Are Calculated

Your monthly mortgage payment consists of four components, commonly abbreviated as PITI:

**Principal** is the portion of your payment that reduces your loan balance. In the early years of a mortgage, this is a small fraction of your payment. By the final years, it makes up the majority.

**Interest** is the cost of borrowing money, calculated as your remaining loan balance multiplied by your monthly interest rate. Because your balance decreases over time, the interest portion of each payment also decreases — this is what an amortization schedule shows.

**Taxes** refers to property taxes, which most lenders collect monthly and hold in escrow until the tax bill is due. Property taxes vary dramatically by state and county — from under 0.3% in Hawaii to over 2.4% in New Jersey.

**Insurance** includes homeowners insurance (typically $100–200/month) and PMI (private mortgage insurance) if your down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price.

#### 15-Year vs. 30-Year Mortgage: Which Is Better?

This is one of the most common mortgage questions, and the answer depends on your financial situation.

A **30-year mortgage** has lower monthly payments, giving you more cash flow flexibility. However, you pay significantly more interest over the life of the loan.

A **15-year mortgage** has higher monthly payments but you build equity faster, pay far less total interest, and typically get a lower interest rate (usually 0.5–0.75% lower than 30-year rates).

Example: $400,000 loan at current rates

- 30-year at 7.0%: $2,661/month — Total interest: $557,960
- 15-year at 6.25%: $3,430/month — Total interest: $217,400

The 15-year saves $340,560 in interest but costs $769 more per month. If you can afford the higher payment, the 15-year is mathematically superior. If the higher payment would stretch your budget uncomfortably, the 30-year with voluntary extra payments is often a better choice.

#### What Is PMI and How Do You Avoid It?

Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is required by most lenders when your down payment is less than 20% of the home's purchase price. PMI typically costs 0.5–1.5% of your loan amount annually, or $150–$450/month on a $400,000 loan.

To avoid PMI: make a 20% down payment, use a piggyback loan (80/10/10 structure), or request PMI cancellation once your equity reaches 20% through appreciation or principal paydown.

#### How to Get the Best Mortgage Rate

Your mortgage rate is determined by your credit score, loan-to-value ratio, debt-to-income ratio, loan type, and current market rates. The single most impactful thing you can control is your credit score:

- 760+ credit score: Best rates available
- 720–759: Very competitive rates
- 680–719: Good rates, minor premium
- 620–679: Higher rates, consider improving credit first
- Below 620: May not qualify for conventional loans

#### How to Use This Calculator

1. Enter the **home price** you are considering
2. Set your **down payment** as a percentage or dollar amount
3. Enter the current **interest rate** — check Bankrate or your lender for current rates
4. Choose your **loan term** (15 or 30 years are most common)
5. Add **property tax rate** for your area (county assessor website has this)
6. Add estimated **HOA** fees if applicable
7. The calculator will automatically add **PMI** if your down payment is under 20%

### FAQ Section

**Q: How much house can I afford?**
A common guideline is the 28/36 rule: spend no more than 28% of your gross monthly income on housing costs (PITI), and no more than 36% on total debt payments including car loans, student loans, and credit cards. On a $100,000 annual salary, that means a maximum housing payment of about $2,333/month.

**Q: What credit score do I need for a mortgage?**
For a conventional loan, most lenders require a minimum 620 credit score, though you will get significantly better rates above 740. FHA loans accept scores as low as 580 with a 3.5% down payment, or 500 with a 10% down payment.

**Q: What is an amortization schedule?**
An amortization schedule is a table showing every monthly payment over the life of your loan, broken down into principal and interest. In the early years, most of your payment goes to interest. Over time, the balance shifts toward principal as your loan balance decreases.

**Q: Should I pay points to lower my interest rate?**
Mortgage points (also called discount points) let you pay upfront to reduce your interest rate — typically 1 point (1% of loan amount) reduces your rate by 0.25%. To decide if it is worth it, calculate your break-even period: divide the point cost by your monthly savings. If you plan to stay in the home longer than the break-even period, buying points makes sense.

**Q: What is the difference between interest rate and APR?**
The interest rate is the base cost of your loan. APR (Annual Percentage Rate) includes the interest rate plus fees like origination fees, broker fees, and mortgage points, expressed as a yearly rate. APR is the more complete number for comparing loans from different lenders.

## Guide 1: Understanding 401(k) Matching

**URL:** `/guides/understanding-401k-matching`
**Read time:** 5 min
**Title tag:** `Understanding 401(k) Matching — The Closest Thing to Free Money`
**Meta description:** `Learn how 401(k) employer matching works, how to maximize your match, and why not contributing enough to get the full match is leaving money on the table.`

### Content

If your employer offers a 401(k) match and you are not contributing enough to capture the full match, you are effectively turning down part of your compensation. Employer matching is the closest thing to free money in personal finance — and yet millions of Americans leave it uncaptured every year.

#### How 401(k) Matching Works

An employer match means your company contributes to your 401(k) based on how much you contribute. The most common matching formula is:

**"We match 100% of your contributions up to 3% of your salary, plus 50% of contributions between 3% and 5%."**

On a $70,000 salary, this means:

- You contribute 5% = $3,500
- Employer matches 100% of first 3% = $2,100
- Employer matches 50% of next 2% = $700
- Total employer contribution = $2,800
- Your effective return on day one: $2,800 / $3,500 = **80% instant return**

No investment in the world offers an 80% guaranteed day-one return. That is why contributing at least enough to capture your full match is universally considered the first step in any personal finance plan.

#### Common Matching Formulas

Matching formulas vary by employer. Common structures include:

- **Dollar-for-dollar match up to X%:** Employer matches 100% of contributions up to a set percentage of salary
- **Partial match:** Employer matches 50 cents per dollar up to a set percentage
- **Tiered match:** Different rates at different contribution levels (like the example above)
- **Fixed contribution:** Employer contributes a set percentage regardless of employee contributions

Check your employee benefits portal or ask HR for your exact matching formula.

#### The Vesting Schedule Trap

There is a catch: most employer matches are subject to a **vesting schedule**, meaning you only keep the matched money if you stay at the company long enough.

Common vesting schedules:

- **Immediate vesting:** You keep 100% of the match from day one
- **Cliff vesting:** 0% until a set date, then 100% (e.g., 0% for year 1–2, then 100%)
- **Graded vesting:** Percentage increases each year (e.g., 20% per year over 5 years)

If you plan to leave a job, check your vesting status first. Leaving two months before full vesting can cost thousands of dollars.

#### What Is the 401(k) Contribution Limit for 2025?

The IRS sets annual limits on 401(k) contributions:

- Employee contribution limit: **$23,500** (up from $23,000 in 2024)
- Catch-up contribution (age 50+): **additional $7,500**
- Total limit including employer match: **$70,000**

Employer match contributions do not count toward the $23,500 employee limit — they count toward the $70,000 combined limit.

#### Should I Choose Traditional or Roth 401(k)?

Many employers now offer both options:

**Traditional 401(k):** Contributions are pre-tax, reducing your taxable income today. You pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement.

**Roth 401(k):** Contributions are after-tax, meaning no immediate tax break. Qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free, including all the growth.

General guidance: If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than today, traditional is often better. If you expect to be in the same or higher bracket, Roth is often better. Many people contribute to both to hedge against future tax rate uncertainty.

#### Action Steps

1. Find out your exact employer matching formula (HR or benefits portal)
2. Calculate the minimum contribution needed to capture the full match
3. Increase your contribution to at least that level immediately
4. If you can contribute more, consider maxing out your 401(k) next
5. Review your investment fund selection — most people should be in a target-date fund or low-cost index funds

## Guide 2: Debt Avalanche vs. Debt Snowball

**URL:** `/guides/debt-avalanche-vs-snowball`
**Read time:** 7 min
**Title tag:** `Debt Avalanche vs. Debt Snowball: Which Pays Off Debt Faster?`
**Meta description:** `We break down the debt avalanche and debt snowball methods mathematically and psychologically. See which strategy saves the most money and which keeps you most motivated.`

### Content

Two methods dominate personal finance advice for paying off multiple debts: the debt avalanche and the debt snowball. They differ in one key way — the order in which you pay off your debts. That single difference has significant mathematical and psychological implications.

#### How Both Methods Work

Both methods share the same foundation: you make minimum payments on all your debts, then put every extra dollar toward one target debt until it is gone, then roll that payment into the next debt.

**Debt Avalanche:** Target the debt with the highest interest rate first, regardless of balance size.

**Debt Snowball:** Target the debt with the smallest balance first, regardless of interest rate.

#### The Math: Avalanche Wins

The debt avalanche is mathematically optimal. By eliminating your highest-rate debt first, you reduce the amount of interest accruing across your total debt load as quickly as possible.

**Example scenario:**

- Credit Card A: $8,000 at 24% APR — minimum $160/month
- Credit Card B: $3,000 at 19% APR — minimum $60/month
- Car Loan: $12,000 at 6% APR — minimum $230/month
- Total extra payment budget: $500/month above minimums

**Avalanche result:** Pay off in 28 months, total interest paid: $4,218

**Snowball result:** Pay off in 29 months, total interest paid: $4,891

Difference: The avalanche saves $673 and finishes one month faster in this scenario. The gap widens significantly when interest rate differences are larger.

#### The Psychology: Snowball Often Wins in Practice

Here is the uncomfortable truth: the mathematically correct answer is not always the right answer for every person.

The debt snowball creates quick wins. When you eliminate Credit Card B ($3,000 balance) first, you get a victory in a few months. That victory is real — you have one fewer payment, one fewer creditor, and psychological proof that the plan works. Research in behavioral economics consistently shows that people are more likely to maintain a debt payoff plan when they experience early wins, even if those wins cost slightly more in interest.

Dave Ramsey built an entire financial empire on this insight: if the mathematically superior method causes people to quit, it is not actually superior for them.

#### How to Choose

**Choose the avalanche if:**

- You are analytically motivated and the math drives your behavior
- Your highest-rate debt has a manageable balance (not so large it takes years to eliminate)
- You have strong financial discipline and will not lose motivation
- The interest rate differences between your debts are significant (10%+ spread)

**Choose the snowball if:**

- You have struggled to stick to debt payoff plans before
- You need early wins to stay motivated
- Your highest-rate debt also has a very large balance
- The interest rate differences between your debts are small (less than 5% spread)

**The hybrid approach:** Some people prioritize any debt with a very high rate (above 20%) first regardless of balance, then switch to snowball order for remaining debts. This captures most of the mathematical benefit while preserving motivation.

#### What Actually Matters Most

The difference between avalanche and snowball is almost always less than $1,000–$2,000 over the course of a payoff plan. What matters far more:

1. **How much extra you pay each month.** Increasing your extra payment from $200 to $400 saves more than any method choice.
2. **Whether you stick to the plan.** A snowball plan you follow for 3 years beats an avalanche plan you abandon after 6 months every single time.
3. **Whether you stop accumulating new debt.** Both methods fail if you keep adding to your balances.

## Guide 3: The Rule of 72 Explained

**URL:** `/guides/rule-of-72`
**Read time:** 4 min
**Title tag:** `The Rule of 72 Explained — How Long Until Your Money Doubles?`
**Meta description:** `Learn the Rule of 72 — the simple mental math trick that tells you exactly how long it takes for your investments to double at any given return rate.`

### Content

The Rule of 72 is the most useful mental math shortcut in personal finance. It lets you estimate — instantly, without a calculator — how long it will take for any investment to double in value.

#### The Formula

Divide 72 by your annual return rate. The result is the approximate number of years to double your money.

**Years to double = 72 ÷ Annual Return Rate**

Examples:

- 6% return: 72 ÷ 6 = **12 years to double**
- 8% return: 72 ÷ 8 = **9 years to double**
- 10% return: 72 ÷ 10 = **7.2 years to double**
- 12% return: 72 ÷ 12 = **6 years to double**

#### Why It Works

The Rule of 72 is an approximation of the precise formula for doubling time: ln(2) / ln(1 + r), where r is the return rate. The number 72 is chosen because it is close to 69.3 (the mathematically exact constant) but is easily divisible by many common return rates: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 24, and 36.

The rule is accurate within about 1–2% for return rates between 4% and 15% — more than precise enough for planning purposes.

#### Practical Uses

**Evaluating investments:** If someone offers you an investment promising 15% annual returns, the Rule of 72 says your money doubles every 4.8 years. If that sounds too good — it probably is.

**Understanding inflation's damage:** The Rule of 72 works in reverse for inflation. At 3% inflation, purchasing power halves in 24 years. At 7% inflation, it halves in about 10 years. This is why inflation is called the "silent tax."

**Comparing debt vs. investing:** A credit card charging 24% interest means your debt doubles in 3 years (72 ÷ 24) if you make no payments. This viscerally illustrates why eliminating high-interest debt is often the best "investment" you can make.

**Setting expectations for retirement:** If you are 35 with $50,000 saved and expect a 7% return, your money doubles roughly every 10 years: $100,000 at 45, $200,000 at 55, $400,000 at 65 — without adding another dollar. This shows both the power of early saving and the cost of starting late.

#### Limitations

The Rule of 72 assumes a consistent annual return rate, which real investments do not provide. Stock markets fluctuate significantly year to year. The rule is a planning heuristic, not a prediction.

It also does not account for taxes. In a taxable account, annual taxes on gains reduce the effective compounding rate. In a Roth IRA or 401(k), tax-free or tax-deferred growth means the full return compounds — one of many reasons tax-advantaged retirement accounts are so valuable.

#### The Rule of 72 in Reverse

You can also use the Rule of 72 to find the return rate needed to double your money in a target time:

**Required return = 72 ÷ Years to double**

- Want to double in 5 years? You need: 72 ÷ 5 = **14.4% annual return** (aggressive)
- Want to double in 10 years? You need: 72 ÷ 10 = **7.2% annual return** (achievable with index funds)
- Want to double in 20 years? You need: 72 ÷ 20 = **3.6% annual return** (conservative)

This reverse application is useful for reality-checking financial goals and understanding what return rate your plan actually requires.
