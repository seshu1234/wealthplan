# WealthPath — Content Guidelines for AI Agents

**Read this entire file before writing a single word of content.**

## What WealthPath Is

A US personal finance calculator and education site. Our audience is Americans aged 25–55 making real financial decisions — paying off debt, buying homes, planning retirement, managing taxes.

We are **not** a blog. We are a tool site that uses content to support SEO and build trust. Every piece of content must serve one of these purposes:

1. Help a page rank for a specific keyword
2. Explain the math behind a calculator
3. Build trust with Google's E-E-A-T algorithm
4. Drive users toward a calculator or affiliate link

## Voice & Tone

**Write like a knowledgeable friend, not a financial textbook.**

The right tone is: direct, clear, slightly conversational, never condescending. Imagine explaining something to a smart 35-year-old who is not a finance professional but is serious about their money.

**Do:**

- Use "you" and "your" throughout
- Use short sentences and short paragraphs (3–4 sentences max per paragraph)
- State the most important thing first, then explain it
- Use specific numbers and examples ("$10,000 at 8% for 30 years = $100,627")
- Cite sources (IRS.gov, SSA.gov, SEC.gov, Federal Reserve) for any specific figure
- End sections with a clear takeaway or action step

**Do not:**

- Start sentences with "In today's financial landscape..."
- Use phrases like "it's important to note", "it goes without saying", "needless to say"
- Use "utilize" when "use" works
- Write more than 25 words in a single sentence
- Use the passive voice ("it is recommended") — use active voice ("we recommend")
- Add disclaimers mid-content — the sitewide disclaimer covers it
- Use em-dashes excessively
- Write filler paragraphs that repeat what was already said
- Start with a question as the first sentence ("Have you ever wondered...")
- Use "game-changer", "deep dive", "holistic", "leverage" (the verb), "at the end of the day"

## Content Types & Exact Specifications

---

### Type 1: Calculator Page SEO Content

Every calculator page needs **800–1,200 words** of text content surrounding the calculator widget. This content is what Google reads and ranks.

**Required sections in this exact order:**

```
1. Intro paragraph (50–80 words)
2. [CALCULATOR WIDGET]
3. How to Use This Calculator (150–200 words)
4. What Is [Topic]? (200–300 words)
5. [Topic-specific deep section — varies by calculator] (200–300 words)
6. Key Numbers / Current Limits (100–150 words + table if applicable)
7. FAQ (4–6 questions, 50–100 words each)
8. Related calculators (3 links, one sentence each)
```

**Intro paragraph rules:**

- First sentence must contain the primary keyword naturally
- State what the calculator does and who it's for
- Do not start with "Welcome to" or "This calculator"
- Example good intro: _"Calculate exactly how your 401(k) grows over time — including your employer match, salary increases, and tax advantages. Enter your details below to see a year-by-year projection of your retirement balance."_

**How to Use section rules:**

- Numbered list, one step per input field
- Name the input exactly as it appears in the UI
- Tell the user what value to enter, not just that they should enter something
- End with what to look at in the results

**What Is [Topic] section rules:**

- Define the concept in plain English in the first sentence
- Second paragraph: explain why it matters in dollar terms
- Third paragraph: one concrete example with real numbers
- No more than 3 paragraphs
- Cite at least one government source (IRS, SEC, SSA, Federal Reserve)

**Key Numbers section rules:**

- Use a table for anything with multiple data points (contribution limits, tax brackets, rates)
- Label the tax year clearly ("2025 figures — updated January 2025")
- Include a one-sentence note saying figures are updated annually

**FAQ rules:**

- Questions must be things real people search (check Google's "People Also Ask" for the keyword)
- Each answer: 2–4 sentences, directly answering the question
- No question should start with "What should I..."
- Every FAQ page gets FAQ schema markup — the developer adds this, not the writer
- Minimum 4 questions, maximum 6

---

### Type 2: Guide Articles (Long-form)

Target length: **1,500–2,500 words**

These are educational articles linked from the homepage and blog. They target broader keywords like "how to pay off debt" or "401k vs Roth IRA".

**Required structure:**

```
H1: [Keyword-rich title]
Intro paragraph (100–150 words)
[Optional: key takeaway box — 3 bullet points]
H2: Section 1
H2: Section 2
H2: Section 3
[Calculator CTA — link to relevant tool]
H2: Section 4 (if needed)
H2: Frequently Asked Questions
[Related articles — 2–3 links]
```

**Title rules:**

- Must contain the primary keyword
- Formats that work: "X vs Y: Which Is Better?", "How to [Do Thing] in [Year]", "The Complete Guide to [Topic]", "[Number] Ways to [Achieve Goal]"
- Target 50–60 characters
- Never use clickbait ("You Won't Believe...", "The Secret to...")

**Intro paragraph rules (guides):**

- Open with a specific, relatable scenario or a striking number — not a definition
- Example: _"The average American with credit card debt pays $1,380 per year in interest alone. If that sounds like you, the method you choose to pay it off will determine whether it takes 2 years or 5."_
- State what the article covers and what the reader will know by the end
- 3–4 sentences maximum

**Section rules:**

- Each H2 section: 200–400 words
- Every section must have at least one concrete example with numbers
- If comparing two things (avalanche vs snowball), use a consistent example throughout the whole article — same debt amounts, same income
- End every section with one sentence that either summarizes or transitions

**Calculator CTA placement:**

- Insert after the 2nd or 3rd section, not at the very end
- Format: Card or callout box — "Use our [Calculator Name] to run these numbers for your exact situation → [link]"
- Never just drop a bare link in the middle of prose

---

### Type 3: Required Site Pages (About, Privacy, Disclaimer, Contact)

These exist for AdSense approval and legal compliance. They must sound human, not legal-boilerplate.

**About page rules:**

- 300–500 words
- Explain what the site does, who it's for, and why it exists
- Mention US-specific focus explicitly ("built for the American tax system")
- Include the financial disclaimer reference
- Do not include fake team bios or fake founder stories
- Do not claim credentials you don't have

**Privacy Policy rules:**

- Must explicitly mention Google AdSense cookies and how to opt out
- Must mention Google Analytics
- Must state that calculator inputs are never transmitted or stored on servers
- Must include a last-updated date
- Use plain English sections with clear H2 headings — no wall of legal text

**Disclaimer rules:**

- Must say "for educational purposes only" and "not financial advice"
- Must recommend consulting a licensed CFP or CPA for major decisions
- Must be linked in the footer AND shown as a small note on every calculator page
- Keep it short — 200–300 words

---

## SEO Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### Keywords

**Primary keyword:** One per page. Use it in:

- The H1 (exact match or close variant)
- The first 100 words of body content
- One H2 subheading
- The meta title (50–60 characters)
- The meta description (140–155 characters)

**Secondary keywords:** 2–4 per page. Use naturally in H2s and body text. Do not force them.

**Never:**

- Use a keyword more than once every 200 words (keyword stuffing)
- Put the same primary keyword on two different pages (cannibalization)
- Write a meta description that doesn't match the page content

### Meta Title Formula

```
[Primary Keyword] ([Year]) — WealthPath
```

Example: `Compound Interest Calculator (2025) — WealthPath`
Maximum 60 characters. Year helps CTR and signals freshness.

### Meta Description Formula

```
[What the tool does]. [What the user gets]. [One differentiator].
```

Example: `Calculate how your money grows with compound interest. See year-by-year projections, total interest earned, and inflation-adjusted results. Free, no signup required.`

### Internal Linking Rules

- Every calculator page must link to at least 3 other calculators
- Every guide must link to at least 1 calculator
- Use descriptive anchor text — never "click here" or "learn more"
- Link to the most relevant page, not just any page

---

## E-E-A-T Signals (Critical for Finance)

Google applies extra scrutiny to finance content (YMYL — Your Money Your Life). Every page needs these signals:

**Experience signals:**

- Use specific dollar examples ("a $400,000 mortgage at 7%") not vague ones ("a typical mortgage")
- Reference real scenarios ("if you're 35 and just started your first job...")
- Mention current year and update dates

**Expertise signals:**

- Cite IRS.gov, SSA.gov, SEC.gov, Federal Reserve for any specific figure
- Link out to authoritative sources (opens in new tab)
- Add "Reviewed for accuracy — [Month Year]" at the top of each calculator page

**Authoritativeness signals:**

- Consistent brand voice across all pages
- No contradictory information between pages
- Disclaimer on every calculator page (one line is fine: "Results are estimates for educational purposes. Not financial advice.")

**Trustworthiness signals:**

- No broken links anywhere
- No placeholder text ("Lorem ipsum", "Coming soon") on live pages
- Privacy policy linked in footer
- Contact page with working email or form

## What Makes Content Fail AdSense Review

Avoid all of these:

- Thin content: a calculator with fewer than 400 words of surrounding text
- Duplicate content: copying text from IRS.gov, Investopedia, or any other site
- Misleading claims: "guaranteed returns", "best investment ever"
- Outdated data without an update date
- Pages with no internal links
- Broken external links
- Content that contradicts the disclaimer (e.g., saying "you should invest in X")
- Any India-specific financial content (EPF, PPF, GST, SIP) on this US-focused site
